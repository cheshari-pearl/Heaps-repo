# Heaps-repo
HEAPS
Heaps are binary tree structures that follow a specific rule. There are two types of heaps:
One is a min-heap where the parent node is less than or equal to the value of its children.
The second is the max-heap where the parent node is greater than or equal to the value of its children.

ADVANTAGES OF HEAPS
1. Easy to use
2. Space-efficient
3. Flexible 
4. Efficient

DISADVANTAGES OF HEAPS
1. Limited functionality
2. Cannot be randomly accessed
3. Cannot be sorted
4. They are not thread-safe

APPLICATIONS OF BINARY TREES
1. Used to implement file systems.
2. They are used in sorting algorithms.
3. Used in database systems to store data.
4. Used in binary search algorithms to search for specific elements.
